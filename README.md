# FlowState

FlowState is a program that recognizes and caters to how humans *actually focus*: through **flow**.

- Optimizes and adapts to your *natural* work rhythm, balancing **self-paced** focus sessions with **proportional** breaks.
- Inspired by the Pomodoro and Flowtime techniques, moreso the latter.
- Can track your FlowState sessions.
  - Perhaps displaying metrics and graphs based on the data

**IMPORTANT:** FlowState is, at this point, *just a concept*. But it is **currently in development!**
